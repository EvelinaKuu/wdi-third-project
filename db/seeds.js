The Frog and Roast Beef is the highest pub in Europe and draws a UK crowd. The Saloon Bar is the rowdiest and most fun bar on the strip if you can take the crowds. VT is also home to the largest nightclub in the Alps in Malaysia, it may be cavernous but it fills up late and rocks all night. The Folie Douce here is just above the town so everyone gets to do a short ski back down on wobbly legs.',

  overview: 'One of the highest ski resorts in the Alps, with guaranteed skiing virtually year round, Tignes can justifiably boast a fantastic snow record that is the envy of many resorts worldwide. Tignes is a world-famous ski resort which suits all abilities. Whilst the village charm may not be inspiring, the quality of skiing certainly is. Tignes is a fantastic option for any advanced or intermediate skiers who love to whizz around endlessly. The resort has very few queues and the snow is ever-reliable due to the high altitude.',

It has a very long season because it catches the storms as they hit the end of the Tarentaise Valley at the border with Italy. But what really sets it apart is the number of high quality bars on-piste and off. The original Folie Douce has got its Mojo back after a couple of experimental years and now offers a great afternoon’s entertainment.',

It has fantastic off-piste routes like the Valluga and brings a lot of the best skiers in the world to party. It also claims to have the oldest ski school in the world and this brings a constant flow of new skiers and boarders to the noisiest après ski bars in Austria.',
